{"name":"The castafiore framework","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome.\r\nCastafiore framework is a new web framework with the following features\r\n\r\n1. Write in one single language java\r\n2. Fully object oriented\r\n3. No custom compilation to generate javascript like GWT\r\n4. Can be server centric, or client centric or both. Everything with the same API\r\n5. Although for backend application there is no need for HTML or CSS, templates can be used easily.\r\n   Actually, the framework provides the easiest way to use html template. Scripting can be done in any scripting language available with java\r\n6. Lazy loading of resources like javascript, and css\r\n7. Very simple API.\r\n8. Easily integrate any javascript libraries\r\n9. many more....\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThe framework is consisted of the following files\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaven\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.castafiore</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>org.castafiore.ui</artifactId>\r\n  <version>x.x.x</version>\r\n  <type>war</type>\r\n</dependency>\r\n\r\nDownload war\r\nhttp://www..com \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\n####Preparing your workspace\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to start using castafiore web framework is to download the startup war file which contains everything needed.\r\nSimply download it, add all the libraries and web.xml and index.jsp in your workspace.\r\n\r\nYou will see a file called app-config.xml in the src directory. This\r\n\r\n1. Create your web project\r\n2. Add the following entry in your web.xml\r\nThis servlet is the main entry point of castafiore web framework\r\n\r\n```\r\n<servlet>\r\n   <servlet-name>castafiore</servlet-name>\r\n   <servlet-class>org.castafiore.web.servlet.CastafioreServlet</servlet-class>\r\n   <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>\r\n</servlet>\r\n\r\n<servlet-mapping>\r\n   <servlet-name>castafiore</servlet-name>\r\n   <url-pattern>/castafiore/*</url-pattern>\r\n\r\n</servlet-mapping>\r\n```\r\n3. You need a spring application context file which will act as your application registry.\r\nfile should obey the following convention\r\na. Its name should be <anyname>-config.xml\r\nb. It should be in classpath with package config/\r\n4. finally to run your application, you will need a page (html, jsp) it does not matter.\r\nHowever, the page should be in the root directory of your web application.\r\n\r\nSay you have created an application with name helloworld. To run the application, you need to add the following scripts in your page \r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"castafiore/resource/classpath/org/castafiore/resource/js/ext.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"castafiore/resource/classpath/ckeditor/ckeditor.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nCreate a div where you want your application to be rendered. The div should have same id as your application. In this case <div id=\"helloworld\"></div>\r\nFinally, the javascript to render the application\r\n<script>\r\ncastafiore('helloworld');\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: For convenience, we have provided an index.jsp file which already contains every needed.\r\nSo, to run your application with name 'helloworld', you simply have to execute the url as shown below\r\nindex.jsp?applicationid=helloworld\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to start coding your first application is probably using maven.\r\nYou simply need to add the dependency stated above in your pom.xml and your are ready.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using maven, you can download the war, unzip it, put all the libraries in your class path.\r\nThen rename the war into your servlet container.\r\nTo run your codes, simple deploy all class files in the classes directory of the downloaded war\r\n\r\n### Writing your first application.\r\nObviously we are going to start with the good old \"Hello world\".\r\n\r\nAfter going through this first tutorial, you will be able to do the following\r\n\r\n1. Create a castafiore application\r\n2. Register the application in the context\r\n3. Write the necessary code to display \"Hello world\" on your browser\r\n3. Deploy and run the application\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate a new java class that extends org.castafiore.ui.ex.EXApplication\r\n\r\n`public class ShowCase extends EXApplication`\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
